Date: January 26, 2024 <br>
Essential Topics: Recursion, methods, passing arguments as parameters <br>
Language Used: Java <br>
IDE: Eclipse <br>

## Instructions:

### Power Calculation:
<li> Develop a recursive Java function named powerRecursive to calculate the result of raising a base number to an exponent. <br> </li>
<li> Create a Java class with a main method. <br> </li>
<li> Define a recursive function powerRecursive that takes a base number and an exponent as parameters. <br> </li>
<li> Implement the recursive logic to calculate the power. <br>
<li> Test the function with different base and exponent values in the main method. <br>

### Bubble Sort:
<li> Implement a recursive Java function named recursiveBubbleSort for the Bubble Sort algorithm.
<li> Create a Java class with a main method.
<li> Define a recursive function recursiveBubbleSort that takes an array and its length as parameters.
<li> Implement the recursive Bubble Sort logic to sort the array.
<li> Test the function with different arrays in the main method.

### Vowel Counter:
<li> Implement a recursive Java function named countVowelsRecursive to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
<li> Create a Java class with a main method.
<li> Define a recursive function countVowelsRecursive that takes a string as a parameter.
<li> Implement the recursive logic to count vowels in the string.
<li> Test the function with different strings containing vowels in the main method.
