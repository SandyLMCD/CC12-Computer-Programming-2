Date: January 26, 2024

Instructions:
Power Calculation:
Develop a recursive Java function named powerRecursive to calculate the result of raising a base number to an exponent.
Create a Java class with a main method.
Define a recursive function powerRecursive that takes a base number and an exponent as parameters.
Implement the recursive logic to calculate the power.
Test the function with different base and exponent values in the main method.

Bubble Sort:
Implement a recursive Java function named recursiveBubbleSort for the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Create a Java class with a main method.
Define a recursive function recursiveBubbleSort that takes an array and its length as parameters.
Implement the recursive Bubble Sort logic to sort the array.
Test the function with different arrays in the main method.

Vowel Counter:
Implement a recursive Java function named countVowelsRecursive to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
Create a Java class with a main method.
Define a recursive function countVowelsRecursive that takes a string as a parameter.
Implement the recursive logic to count vowels in the string.
Test the function with different strings containing vowels in the main method.
